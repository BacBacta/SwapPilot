## Tips for Best Results

### Optimize Your Swaps

1. **Compare Routes**: Always check the comparison view for alternative routes
2. **Watch Gas**: Time your swaps during low network congestion
3. **Use MAX Carefully**: Leave some BNB for gas fees

### Avoid Common Issues

1. **Insufficient Gas**: Keep at least 0.01 BNB for transaction fees
2. **Slippage Errors**: Increase slippage for volatile tokens
3. **Stale Quotes**: Refresh if quotes are older than 30 seconds
