### The DeFi Landscape

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized the way users interact with financial services. The ability to swap tokens without intermediaries has become a cornerstone of the Web3 ecosystem. However, the proliferation of DEX protocols has created a fragmented liquidity landscape where finding the best price requires significant effort and expertise.
